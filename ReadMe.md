# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è MailShield ‚Äî Email Spam/Phishing Detector

MailShield is a local mini-application that detects whether an email text is suspicious (spam or phishing) or not, using either a pre-trained Hugging Face model or an SVM model trained on a public dataset.

---

## Main Features
- **Simple Gradio interface**: paste an email or use the provided examples, get an instant answer.
- **Dual AI engine**:
  - Hugging Face model (BERT-tiny fine-tuned for spam/phishing)
  - SVM model trained on a Kaggle dataset (5170 emails)
- **Example buttons**: automatically insert a real (ham or spam) email from the dataset to test the tool.
- **Confidence score** (for the Hugging Face model).
- **Clear and reusable Python code**.

   - Click on "Example Spam" to insert a suspicious (spam) email from the dataset.
   - You can also paste your own email text in the input box.

2. **Analyze the email**:
   - Click on "Analyze email (Hugging Face Model)" to use the BERT-tiny model.
   - Click on "Analyze email (Custom Trained Model)" to use the SVM model.

3. **Read the result**:
   - The verdict will appear in the "Result" box.
   - For the Hugging Face model, a confidence score is also displayed.
